## BG-Analysis:

While living with diabetes, it is important to maintain blood glucose levels in range as much as possible so that one function and do all of the things that they want to do. 

For this project, I took a look at my own glucose monitor readings over the span of two weeks to see what steps I could take to keep my sugars in range. 

## Question: 

What patterns exist in my blood glucose over the last two weeks that show I need to change my diabetes treatment plan?


## Findings: 

1. My blood glucose generally stays within the 90s and 160s with Thursday's and Monday's being higher than average.My weekends and on Tuesday my blood sugar does not venture much to the higher than my range 80-140. Which makes sense based on my scheudle, as my days are slower and calmer during the weekends as opposed to the work week or at the start of the work week. So, possibly being better with stress when work starts during the week and when it picks up on Thursdays just before the end of the week. 

 
 2. I am having a lot of hypoglycemic episodes. 
 
 3. I am also having trouble over correcting my highs which is leading to some of the issues with hypoglycemia. 
 
 
This means that I will have to practice more patience when correcting for high blood sugars to avoid those up and down and up rollercoasters of my sugars which could potentially give me a better time in range.


## Recommendations: 
1. Incorporate stress management techniques that will help with maintaining calm. 

2. Making sure I am not missing important meal times and ensuring that the space for eating good meals is prioritized over anything. Also looking at my basal to see if I am getting too much insulin. 

3. Working on maintaining patience when my sugar rises. Incorporating techniques to work on anxious feelings and being patient when sugars begin to be out of range. 

## Limitations: 

I took the data from my continous glucose monitor but it would be helpful if I can also track the meal times, insulin delivered, and foods that I eat with my blood sugar readings. This would add more to project but also enable me to create and test additional hypothesis about how certain meals impact me, how much stressful moments have an impact and to see if more clearly which adjustments to make to my diabetes treatment plan.
